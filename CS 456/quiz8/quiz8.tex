	\item[\textbf{1.}] Prove that $L = \{ a^n b^m c^q : q > n \geq 0, q > m \geq 0\}$ is not context-free given that $\Sigma = \{ a, b, c \}$.

		\begin{proof}
			Suppose $\Sigma = \{ a, b, c \}$ and let $L = \{ a^n b^m c^q : q > n \geq 0, q > m \geq 0\}$. Further, suppose by contradiction that $L$ is a context-free language.
			Clearly $L$ is an infinite language so the Pumping Lemma for context-free languages can be applied; moreover, if $w = a^m b^m c^{m+1}$ then $|w| = 3m + 1 \geq m$ illustrates
			that $w$ can be decomposed to $w = uvxyz$ with $|vxy| \leq m$ and $|vy| \geq 1$ such that $w_i = uv^ixy^iz \in L$ for all $i \in \mathbb{N} \cup \{ 0 \}$. \\

			Let us consider two cases regarding $v$ and $y$. In the case that $n_c(v) > 0$ or $n_c(y) > 0$, at least one of them contains $c$, let us pump $w$ down to $w_0 = uxz$. Since
			$|vxy| \leq m$, it follows that $a$ cannot be a substring of $vxy$ and so $n_a(w_0) \geq n_c(w_0)$ which is a contradiction to the assumption that $w_0 \in L$. \\

			Otherwise, let $n_c(v) = 0$ and $n_c(y) = 0$, in other words, $v$ and $y$ are entirely composed of $a$'s and/or $b$'s (with the possibility that $v = \lambda$ or $y =
			\lambda$, but not both). Without loss of generality, suppose $v$ contains at least one $a$. Then it follows that $1 \leq n_a(v) < n_c(w)$. Furthermore, by the Archimedean
			Principle there exists an $i \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $n_a(w_i) \geq i \cdot n_a(v) > n_c(w) = n_c(w_i)$ and so $w_i \notin L$ which is a contradiction. \\

			Provided that all cases lead to a contradiction, we can see that $L$ is not a context-free language.
